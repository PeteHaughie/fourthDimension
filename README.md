# The Fourth Dimension

Zbigniew Rybczyński's Fourth Dimension is a wildly creative and hypnotic piece osetnsibly about the Adam and Eve creation myth but is actually a scultpure made of time.

Through an incredibly painstaking method of splicing frames horizontally with razorblades and reconstructing them with tape. Each vertical slice is offset a frame from the last and new shapes and structures appear from the passage of movement over time. Fire and ice, door and windows opening and closing, reflections and strong stage composition lead to a confusing and otherworldy effect only possible through unimagineable labour and understanding of the medium of film and editing as an artform unto itself.

Thank you to YouTube content creator Fugue State for undoing all of Rybczński's hard work so I could then redo it in my own way.
